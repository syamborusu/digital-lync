# Overriding : In python, when a sub class provides custom implementation for
#         parent class method, then this concept is called method Overriding.

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Animal Making Sound")
        
class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self): # overriding
        print("Dog Making Sound")

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self): # overriding
        print("Cat Making Sound")
        
a = Animal()
a.sound()
